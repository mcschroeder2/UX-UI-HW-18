                <p>Madeline is an ambitious and proactive designer who values usability and embraces Dieter Rams' notions of simplistic, invisible design. She is passionate about constantly expanding and adapting her skill set and thought processes as the world constantly transforms.</p>
                <p>She is learning UX/UI at UC Berkeley Extension, designing digital marketing assets at Williams Sonoma, and, in her free time, collaborating with various clients as a freelance designer. She thrives amongst curiosity, tenacity, and joy.</p>
                <p>Madeline is actively seeking product design opportunities, with a particular interest in roles based in NY. Open to remote and other location options.</p>
                <p>When she isn't in Figma, Madeline is trying out far too intricate recipes in the kitchen or searching for a flat running route in SF.</p>
